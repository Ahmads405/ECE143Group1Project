# ECE143Group1Project
## File Structure
We only had one jupyter notebook that we split into parts and worked on separately. Along with that the only other file in this repository is a csv of the COMPAS data that we used.

## How to run code
Since we did EDA, the code is just run simply in the jupyter notebook, by running each cell.

## Dependencies
Pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, and numpy
